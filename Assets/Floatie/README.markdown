# Floating tooltip for Unity

See the [example video](https://gfycat.com/SleepyRealBlacknorwegianelkhound)

Use this script to spawn a floating object in front of the camera, and
optionally have a line pointing to an object of interest.

Useful for VR, when you need to draw user's attention to a point out of sight.

Example scene requires [SteamVR
asset](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647) to be added to
the project.
